# Austin Johnson — Working Bio Draft

## Core Tagline
AI-native product manager obsessed with APIs and automation, using event-driven Composite AI to dissolve technology constraints for anyone trying to solve complex or creative problems.

## One-Liner
Austin Johnson is an AI-native PM and founder of 28eme, building automation-first experiences that let teams and collaborators ship faster without being limited by tooling.

## Short Bio (70–90 words)
Austin Johnson builds products where automation, APIs, and AI agents intersect. Through 28eme, his personal consulting studio, he helps founders and collaborators prototyping in public, sharing experiments that show how composite AI can remove friction for makers, riders, and anyone pursuing creative projects. At Zapier he applies the same obsession with event-driven design; the details stay private, but the craft informs how he approaches every engagement.

## Extended Bio (150–200 words)
Austin Johnson is an AI-native product manager and founder of 28eme, a personal studio for automation-first and creative side projects. He’s obsessed with bending APIs, event streams, and composite AI to remove constraints—whether the challenge is giving a small team superpowers or instrumenting a personal passion project. Austin brings a problem-first mindset: map the job-to-be-done, compose the AI agents and automations around it, and ship iteratively with clear documentation. At Zapier he applies this craft privately, working across teams to shape event-driven experiences that stay under the hood. In his own work he publishes prototypes, showcases public repos, and explores what AI-native tooling can unlock for cyclists, readers, leatherworkers, runners, and other hobbyists. The through-line is constant: less friction, more flow, and technology that adapts to people—not the other way around.

## Pillars & Sound Bites
- **AI native from day one** — Builds with agents, context windows, and event streams as the default toolkit.
- **APIs as building blocks** — Treats every service as a composable component; orchestrates them with automation rather than reinventing wheels.
- **Problem-first, tooling-second** — Starts with the human or hobby pain point, then crafts the minimum system that makes the work disappear.
- **Bias to shipping** — Experiments in public, maintains a living portfolio, and treats documentation as part of the product.

## Proof Points to Fill In
- Signature 28eme collaborations (name, outcome, metric or story).
- Public experiments or repos that demonstrate AI automation (link + one-sentence takeaway).
- Creative or hobby tracking projects (biking, reading, leatherworking, running) with a highlight or future subpage note.
- Talks, podcasts, essays, or communities that reinforce the narrative.

## Calls to Action (Possible)
1. Invite Austin to collaborate on AI-native automation projects via 28eme.
2. Explore the latest GitHub experiments and prototypes.
3. Subscribe or follow to stay updated on creative side projects as new subpages launch.
