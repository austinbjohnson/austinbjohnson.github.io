# Running Page Outline

## Intent
Highlight training blocks, automate performance insights, and share trails or races that inspire future goals.

## Content Building Blocks
- Weekly mileage charts and surface types (trail, road, track).
- Automation: composite AI to digest Garmin/Strava data into actionable summaries.
- Gear and shoe rotation tracker with mileage alerts.
- Race plans, playlists, and recovery protocols.

## Open Questions
- Which metrics matter most to showcase (HRV, cadence, pace, terrain)?
- Do we embed live dashboards or publish periodic recaps?
- How do we align the running narrative with other hobbies on the site?

## Next Actions
- Export historical running data and identify reliable APIs.
- Sketch the main layout sections (progress, insights, stories).
- Define automation demo (e.g., weekly AI coach note).
