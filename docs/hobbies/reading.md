**Status:** outline  
**Owner:** Austin Johnson  
**Last updated:** 2025-02-14


## Intent
Share reading lists, AI-assisted summaries, and automations that track highlights across mediums.

## Content Building Blocks
- Currently reading, finished books, and queued essays.
- Workflow: automation that collects Kindle/Readwise highlights and produces composite AI briefs.
- Recommendations board with tags (product, AI, craft, storytelling).
- Archive of monthly reading recaps generated via prompt templates.

## Open Questions
- How much detail to show for each title (rating, quotes, learnings)?
- Can we automate ingestion of RSS or newsletter content?
- Do we connect this page to a mailing list or keep it as a living library?

## Next Actions
- Inventory existing highlight exports.
- Draft content model (collections, metadata, automation hooks).
- Prototype AI summary pipeline using a public dataset.
