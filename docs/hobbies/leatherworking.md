**Status:** outline  
**Owner:** Austin Johnson  
**Last updated:** 2025-02-14


## Intent
Document handmade leather projects, track patterns and materials, and surface automation that speeds up craft documentation.

## Content Building Blocks
- Project gallery with photos, materials used, and lessons learned.
- Inventory system for hides, hardware, and tools managed via spreadsheets or Notion.
- Automation ideas: cut-list calculators, pattern versioning, AI-assisted instructions.
- Behind-the-scenes notes on finishing techniques and experiments.

## Open Questions
- What level of detail do we share publicly versus privately?
- Do we want downloadable patterns or just storytelling?
- How might AI assist with measuring, planning, or troubleshooting?

## Next Actions
- Gather photos and notes from past builds.
- Define metadata schema (project type, materials, difficulty, time investment).
- Explore lightweight CMS options or static data files for cataloguing.
