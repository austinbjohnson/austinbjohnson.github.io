# Biking Page Outline

**Status:** outline  
**Owner:** Austin Johnson  
**Last updated:** 2025-02-14


## Intent
Document rides, training insights, automation ideas for route planning, and gear experiments.

## Content Building Blocks
- Ride logs captured via Strava API or manual entries.
- Automation ideas: composite AI summaries of weekly mileage, weather-aware ride recommendations.
- Photo or map embeds highlighting favorite routes.
- Notes on bike maintenance workflows automated with reminders.

## Open Questions
- Which data sources can we pull programmatically (Strava, Garmin, custom trackers)?
- Do we want seasonal goals and progress visualizations?
- What does the call to action look like (newsletter, route sharing, nothing)?

## Next Actions
- Audit existing ride data exports.
- Sketch layout (hero, recent rides, automation panel).
- Define minimum automation demo worth shipping.
