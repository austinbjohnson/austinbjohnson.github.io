# 28eme Documentation Hub

Use this folder to store all planning, editorial, and technical references that support the public site and related projects.

## Structure
- `content/` — voice, messaging, and draft copy.
- `hobbies/` — outlines and research for future hobby subpages.
- `roadmap/` — planning artifacts, release schedules, and backlog.
- `technical/` — deployment notes, DNS instructions, automation experiments.

Each document should start with a short front-matter block noting **status**, **owner**, **last updated**, and **next review date**. Update `docs/changelog.md` whenever major decisions ship.

## Quick Links
- Roadmap overview: `roadmap/plan.md`
- Bio copy draft: `content/about.md`
- Hobby explorations: `hobbies/`
- Deployment reference: `technical/deployment.md` (create as needed)
